# What is Tutorly?

Tutorly is a peer to peer tutoring service. Our app allows users to register as a tutor or learner, or both! Need help on a certain topic? Want to set up recurring sessions? Tutorly allows you to connect with students who have been successful in the exact classes you need help with. 

# Mission Statement

As computer science students, we had to take our fair share of difficult classes. There were often times we struggled on specific concepts. What we realized was that there was not adequite resources to help us. A quick tutoring session from someone who had taken the class would have saved us a lot of time and frustration. Tutorly is being created with the goal of solving this problem for students.
